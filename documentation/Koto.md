# Koto
Contract Address: 0x64C7d8C8Abf28Daf9D441c507CfE9Be678A0929c

## Introduction
Koto is an ERC20 token known for its elegant simplicity, featuring a 5% tax applied to both buying and selling transactions, while exempting transfers from taxation. This tax, collected from exchange volumes, serves as a vital component within the ecosystem, enhancing Koto's value and rewarding users, all without the burdensome specter of inflation that often plagues many protocols and their users.

## Reserves
In lieu of distributing rewards through traditional staking mechanisms, Koto takes a unique approach by accumulating revenue and channeling it into the token's reserves. These reserves offer users a tax-free and low-slippage exit strategy from the system, while also paving the way for potential arbitrage opportunities in the future.

When a user chooses to redeem their Koto tokens, they receive an equivalent amount of Ether, calculated based on the prevailing exchange rate and the quantity of tokens being redeemed. The redemption process requires users to burn their tokens in exchange for the underlying reserves, which introduces an additional deflationary element and accelerates the pace at which reserves accumulate.

As users continually redeem tokens, future revenue from bonds and other products contributes to an accelerated buildup of reserves per token. Over time, this process gains momentum, resulting in several arbitrage opportunities, which can be harnessed through various methods, including bonding, redeeming, and participating in the market for buying or selling.

## Bonds
At the core of Koto's reserve augmentation strategy lies its bond mechanism. These bonds draw inspiration from Olympus-style bonds, but crucially, they do not introduce inflation. Functioning similarly to the original OHM bonds, with tailored adjustments specific to Koto, these bonds operate in one-week intervals.

Beginning at the market price and gradually diminishing over time, users have the opportunity to exchange Koto for Ether without incurring slippage or taxes. In return for these benefits, users actively contribute to the growth of Koto's reserves. It's important to note that Koto's primary objective is to sell all bonds, regardless of their market price, which may occasionally result in bonds being sold at a fraction of their current market value. This strategic approach, coupled with the continuous replenishment of the bond depository, optimizes the protocol for long-term reserve growth. Any unsold bonds in a given round are systematically burned, typically constituting only a small fraction of the total bonds available in that round at the time of writing.
